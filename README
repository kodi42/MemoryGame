## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I used w3schools.com as an HTML/CSS reference

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I encountered a couple challenges when creating this submission. The main one was a roadblock I had trying to make and upload the gif. I started out using quicktime for macOS and trying to use ezgif.com to convert the video to a gif. The length of the video I had was too long to be exported so I ended up having to speed it up and create a gif out of that. Before I figured that I had to speed it up, I tried going to a different gif conversion website like adobe and onlineconverter. These didn’t work for me or have as many features that I needed. After looking at those options I tried to just download the recordit app for my mac but that wasn’t working properly either. It was working so poorly that I ended up having to restart my mac because the recordit app just wouldn’t quit and it wouldn’t show up in the list of my apps so I couldn’t force quit it either. After this whole saga is when I then retreated back to using quicktime coupled with ezgif. This definitely taught me a valuable lesson about patience. If I had waited and just tried to figure out ezgif the first time, I would not have had to go through all this.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would definitely try to add more of the optional features like adding extra buttons and speeding up the playback of each sound. Another feature I really wanted to add was an unlimited feature that kept on going until you stopped and even kept track of how long you have gone for. Lastly, I would’ve tried to play around with the css a little bit more and add much more styling properties. I wanted to make it have a more modern look with a shadow behind every box looking like it was coming off the screen a little bit. I also wanted to play around with the responsiveness a bit more. I changed it a little bit but it was only for a single HTML div box.
